To install better-sqlite3 I had to use newer version of node:

20.9.0

When I used older versions, the prebuilt binaries weren't available and npm was looking for python and visual studio compiler. I pointed npm to arc pro python but didn't have VS and was easier to just upgrade node.

Before for EA client builds we were using 16.20.0 but 20.9.0 also works for client builds
